#History
[ITR mobility](http://itr-mobility.com) started the Monocross project as a mobile framework for their clients in 2010, the year of the iPad. Through conversations at conferences and code camps with other developers, more people became interested in using the C# .NET language that Monocross is built upon, as their mobile framework of choice, so the project was open sourced.
