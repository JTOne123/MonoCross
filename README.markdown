MonoCross is a refinement of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for mobile development using .NET, C# and the Mono Framework.

The pattern enables cross-platform portability of business logic and data access code, (Model + Controller), while supporting full, native and/or platform-specific presentation (Views).

For more information on using the pattern, see [visit the WIKI](https://github.com/ToeJam/MonoCross/wiki)
